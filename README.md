How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Testing periodically is important to ensure code is functional. Errors can be found easier if is monitored closely and frequently. As far as security, choosing the language and framework will help with this. Having your projects backed up and automated will also help.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Communication is key when developing a project for a client. Having guidelines and desired components laid out before beginning will help me develop a successful, efficient product. Validation and verification comes into play when dealing with user needs. Designing a verification table will aid in making sure all necessary aspects of a project are included.
How do I approach designing software?
Deciding which approach to use before beginning is essential (object oriented, etc). Understanding the data lifecycle is also important to make sure nothing goes overlooked. Having a UML (or any kind) sequence diagram helps plot everything out for organization and accuracy.
